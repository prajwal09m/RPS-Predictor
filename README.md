# RPS-Predictor
This project includes a Rock-Paper-Scissors bot that predicts the opponent's next move based on past patterns and adapts its strategy over time. It uses frequency analysis to make smarter choices rather than playing randomly. The files, RPS_game.py and test_module.py have been adapted from freecodecamp. I've worked on RPS_player.py, making a player which can guess one of the bots moves (i.e., abbey, mrugesh, kris, quincy)
To test, main.py runs the whole program.
RPS_player.py is my program
